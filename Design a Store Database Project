#In this SQL, I'm designing a Medical PPE store database and querying data from a table in it to quantify statistics on customer ordering. 

#1. Create a table for all items in the store containing at least 15 items.
CREATE TABLE Medical_PPE (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, quantity INTEGER, size TEXT, price INTEGER, color TEXT);

INSERT INTO Medical_PPE VALUES
(1, "Gloves", 5, "Medium", 15, "Blue"),
(2, "Gloves", 5, "Large", 20, "Black"),
(3, "Face mask", 5, "Small", 15, "Blue"),
(4, "Face mask", 5, "Large", 25, "Black");

#2. Order items by price in descending order. 
SELECT * FROM Medical_PPE;
SELECT item, price FROM Medical_PPE ORDER BY price DESC;

#3. How many items are sold in each category?
SELECT item, SUM(quantity) FROM Medical_PPE GROUP BY item;

#4. Provide statistical information on a customer ordering an item less than or equal to a certain size and less than a certain price.
SELECT item, size, price FROM Medical_PPE WHERE size <="medium"and price <20 GROUP BY size and price;
